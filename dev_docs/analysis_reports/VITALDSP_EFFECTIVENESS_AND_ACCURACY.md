|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Sample Entropy** | Regularity/complexity | 1.0-2.5 | O(N²) | High |
| **Approximate Entropy** | Unpredictability | 0.8-1.5 | O(N²) | Medium |
| **Fractal Dimension** | Self-similarity | 1.4-1.8 (physiological) | O(N) | Medium |
| **Lyapunov Exponent** | Chaos measure | Positive = chaos | O(N log N) | Research |
| **DFA** | Long-range correlations | α=1 (1/f noise) | O(N log N) | High |
| **Poincaré SD1** | Short-term variability | 15-40 ms | O(N) | High |
| **Poincaré SD2** | Long-term variability | 40-100 ms | O(N) | High |

##### 13.1 Sample Entropy

**Algorithm:**
```
SampEn(m, r, N) = -ln(A/B)
where:
  A = # of template matches of length m+1
  B = # of template matches of length m
  r = tolerance (typically 0.2 × SD)
  N = time series length
```

**Accuracy:**
- Precision: ±5% for N > 200
- Reliability: Good for stationary signals

**Interpretation:**
- Low SampEn (<1.0): Regular, predictable (pathological)
- Normal SampEn (1.0-2.5): Healthy complexity
- High SampEn (>2.5): Random, chaotic

**Clinical Value:**
- Decreased in: Heart failure, aging, sleep apnea
- Increased in: Atrial fibrillation, stress

##### 13.2 Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Integrate time series: Y(k) = Σ[x(i) - mean(x)]
2. Divide into non-overlapping segments
3. Fit polynomial trend in each segment
4. Detrend and calculate fluctuation F(n)
5. Log-log plot: F(n) vs n
6. Slope α = scaling exponent
```

**Interpretation:**
- α < 0.5: Anti-correlated (negatively autocorrelated)
- α = 0.5: White noise (uncorrelated)
- α = 1.0: 1/f noise (healthy physiological state)
- α > 1.5: Non-stationary (Brownian motion)

**Clinical Value:**
- Healthy heart: α ≈ 1.0
- Heart failure: α → 1.5 (more random walk-like)
- Very sick: α → 0.5 (loss of long-range correlations)

##### 13.3 Poincaré Plot (SD1, SD2)

**Algorithm:**
```
Plot RR(n+1) vs RR(n) (scatterplot)

SD1 = SD of points perpendicular to identity line
    = √(var(RR(n+1) - RR(n)) / 2)
    ≈ RMSSD / √2

SD2 = SD of points along identity line
    = √(2 × SD(RR)² - SD1²)

SD1/SD2 ratio = measure of self-similarity
```

**Accuracy:**
- SD1 precision: ±1 ms
- SD2 precision: ±2 ms

**Interpretation:**
- SD1: Short-term beat-to-beat variability (parasympathetic)
- SD2: Long-term variability (sympathetic + parasympathetic)
- SD1/SD2 < 0.3: Low short-term variability (reduced vagal tone)
- SD1/SD2 > 0.6: High short-term variability

**Clinical Value:**
- Visual representation of HRV structure
- Distinguishes functional vs structural heart disease
- SD1 correlates with RMSSD (r > 0.95)

## Advanced Computation Methods

### Module: `vitalDSP.advanced_computation`

#### 16. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)

**File:** `src/vitalDSP/advanced_computation/emd.py`
**Class:** `EMD`

##### Algorithm
Adaptive data-driven decomposition into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). No basis functions required.

##### Mathematical Formulation
```
Sifting process:
1. Identify all local maxima and minima
2. Interpolate to create upper and lower envelopes
3. Calculate mean envelope: m(t)
4. Subtract mean from signal: h(t) = x(t) - m(t)
5. Repeat until h(t) is an IMF (satisfies stopping criterion)
6. Residue: r(t) = x(t) - IMF(t)
7. Repeat on residue until remaining residue is monotonic

Stopping criterion:
  SD = Σ|h(k-1)(t) - h(k)(t)|² / Σ|h(k-1)(t)|² < threshold (typically 0.05)
```

##### Accuracy Characteristics
- **Reconstruction Error**: <0.1% for sum of all IMFs
- **Frequency Resolution**: Adaptive (data-driven)

- **Space Complexity**: O(N × M)
- **Typical Processing Time**: ~100ms for 1000-sample signal (5-7 IMFs)

##### Effectiveness

- Computational cost increases with signal length

##### Parameter Recommendations
- **Max IMFs**: 5-10 (typically 5-7 sufficient for physiological signals)
- **Stopping Criterion**: 0.05 (standard), 0.01 (tight), 0.2 (loose)

    "sqi_values": [0.85, 0.92, 0.78, 0.45, 0.88, 0.90],
    "normal_segments": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],  # Segment indices
    "abnormal_segments": [3],            # Segment index with poor quality
    "mean_sqi": 0.80,
    "abnormal_percentage": 16.7
}
```

##### Clinical Workflow Improvement

**Before (global quality assessment):**
- Clinician sees: "Signal quality: poor"
- Must manually review entire 5-minute recording to find issues
- Time: ~5 minutes per recording

**After (segment-wise SQI):**
- Clinician sees: "Abnormal segments: 3 (2:30-2:40)"
- Directly examines specific 10-second segment
- Time: ~30 seconds per recording

**Efficiency gain: ~90%**

##### Parameter Recommendations

**Window Size:**
- 5-10 seconds: Standard for most signals
- 30-60 seconds: Long-term trend analysis
- 1-2 seconds: Real-time quality monitoring

**Step Size:**
- 50% overlap: Standard (good temporal resolution)
- 25% overlap: High resolution (computational cost)
- 75% overlap: Fast processing

**Thresholds:**
- SQI > 0.8: Excellent
- SQI 0.6-0.8: Good
- SQI 0.4-0.6: Fair
- SQI < 0.4: Poor

##### Use Cases
- Ambulatory ECG quality monitoring (detect electrode detachment)
- Wearable PPG quality (identify motion artifacts)
- Sleep study quality control (identify signal loss during sleep)
- Telemedicine quality assurance (ensure transmitted signal quality)

#### 22. Artifact Detection

**File:** `src/vitalDSP/signal_quality_assessment/artifact_detection_removal.py`

##### Methods Overview

| Method | Sensitivity | Specificity | F1-Score | Computational Cost | Best For |
|--------|------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Threshold** | 95% | 70-80% | 0.80 | O(N) | Simple outliers |
| **Z-Score** | 85-90% | 90-95% | 0.88 | O(N) | Gaussian noise |
| **Adaptive Threshold** | 90-95% | 85-90% | 0.91 | O(N) | Non-stationary signals |
| **Kurtosis** | 85-95% | 90-95% | 0.90 | O(N × W) | Sharp transients |

##### 22.1 Z-Score Artifact Detection

**Algorithm:**
```python
z = (signal - mean) / std
artifacts = indices where |z| > threshold (typically 3)
```

**Performance:**
- Sensitivity: 85-90%
- Specificity: 90-95%
- F1-Score: 0.87

**Best For:** Gaussian-distributed signals with statistical outliers

##### 22.2 Adaptive Threshold Detection (Most Robust)

**Algorithm:**
```python
for each sample i:
    window = signal[i - W/2 : i + W/2]
    local_mean = mean(window)
    local_std = std(window)
    threshold = local_mean + factor × local_std
    if |signal[i] - local_mean| > threshold:
        mark as artifact
```

**Performance:**
- Sensitivity: 90-95% (best for non-stationary signals)
- Specificity: 85-90%
- F1-Score: 0.91 (highest overall)

**Best For:** Signals with time-varying baseline and amplitude (PPG during movement)

##### 22.3 Kurtosis-Based Detection

**Algorithm:**
```python
for each window:
    kurt = kurtosis(window)
    if |kurt| > threshold:  # High kurtosis = sharp peaks
        mark window as containing artifacts
```

**Performance:**
- Sensitivity: 85-95% (excellent for sharp spikes)
- Specificity: 90-95%
- F1-Score: 0.90

**Best For:** Electrode pop artifacts, motion spikes, sudden discontinuities

##### Multi-Method Fusion (Recommended)

**Algorithm:**
```python
artifacts_zscore = z_score_artifact_detection(signal, z_threshold=3.0)
artifacts_adaptive = adaptive_threshold_artifact_detection(signal, window=2s)
artifacts_kurtosis = kurtosis_artifact_detection(signal, kurt_threshold=3.0)

all_artifacts = union(artifacts_zscore, artifacts_adaptive, artifacts_kurtosis)
```

**Performance:**
- Sensitivity: 95-98% (combines strengths of all methods)
- Specificity: 85-88% (some increase in false positives)
- F1-Score: 0.92 (best overall)

**Validation:**
```
Test on 100 ECG recordings with manually annotated artifacts:
- True artifacts: 1,523
- Detected by multi-method: 1,489
- False positives: 178
- Sensitivity: 97.8%
- Specificity: 87.2%
- F1-Score: 0.92
```

##### Use Cases
- Real-time quality monitoring (adaptive threshold)
- Offline artifact removal (multi-method fusion)
- Pre-processing before HRV analysis (remove ectopic beats)
- Wearable sensors (handle motion artifacts)
