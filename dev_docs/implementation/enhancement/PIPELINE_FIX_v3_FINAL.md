# Pipeline Fix v3 - FINAL: Upload Data Integration + Stage Icons

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Proper Upload Data Integration

**File:** `src/vitalDSP_webapp/callbacks/analysis/pipeline_callbacks.py`

#### Problem
Pipeline was bypassing upload data validation, allowing it to run without proper data.

#### Solution
Now properly validates and uses uploaded data from the Upload page:

```python
# Lines 107-192: Data Validation
- Check if uploaded_data exists
- Validate data format (list of dicts from df.to_dict("records"))
- Convert to pandas DataFrame
- Auto-detect signal column (checks: 'signal', 'Signal', 'value', etc.)
- Extract signal data and log statistics
- Only start pipeline if data is valid
```

**Error Messages:**
- ❌ "Error: No data uploaded. Please upload and process data first."
- ❌ "Error: Invalid data format. Please process data on Upload page first."
- ❌ Shows specific error if signal column not found

---

### 2. Stage Icon Updates

**File:** `src/vitalDSP_webapp/callbacks/analysis/pipeline_callbacks.py`

#### New Callback Added
**Lines 769-805:** `update_pipeline_step_indicator()`

Updates the visual step progress indicator as pipeline advances:

**Stage Icons:**
- ✅ **Completed stages:** Green checkmark (fa-check-circle)
- 🔄 **Current stage:** Blue spinning icon (fa-circle-notch fa-spin)
- ⚪ **Pending stages:** Gray circle (fa-circle)

**Connector Lines:**
- **Green** for completed sections
- **Gray** for upcoming sections

---

## How It Works Now

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. Upload Data Page
1. User uploads CSV/JSON file
2. User selects columns (time, signal, etc.)
3. User clicks "Process Data"
4. Data is stored in `store-uploaded-data` as `df.to_dict("records")`

#### 2. Pipeline Page
1. User navigates to `/pipeline`
2. Configures pipeline settings (signal type, paths, etc.)
3. Clicks "Run Pipeline"

#### 3. Data Validation (NEW!)
```python
✓ Check if uploaded_data exists
✓ Validate format: list[dict]
✓ Convert to DataFrame
✓ Auto-detect signal column
✓ Extract signal array
✓ Log data statistics
```

#### 4. Pipeline Execution (Simulation Mode)
```
Stage 1 (0.5s) → Data Ingestion        [🔄] 12.5%
Stage 2 (1.0s) → Quality Screening     [🔄] 25%
Stage 3 (1.5s) → Parallel Processing   [🔄] 37.5%
Stage 4 (2.0s) → Quality Validation    [🔄] 50%
Stage 5 (2.5s) → Segmentation          [🔄] 62.5%
Stage 6 (3.0s) → Feature Extraction    [🔄] 75%
Stage 7 (3.5s) → Intelligent Output    [🔄] 87.5%
Stage 8 (4.0s) → Output Package        [✅] 100%
```

#### 5. Visual Updates
- **Progress bar** increments 12.5% per stage
- **Stage icons** update:
  - Previous stages → ✅ Green checkmark
  - Current stage → 🔄 Blue spinner
  - Future stages → ⚪ Gray circle
- **Connector lines** turn green as stages complete
- **Stage details** panel shows current metrics

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Have a signal data file (CSV or JSON)
2. File should have at least one numeric column

### Test Procedure

#### Step 1: Upload Data
```bash
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8050/upload
2. Upload your signal file
3. Select columns:
   - Time column (optional)
   - Signal column (required)
4. Click "Process Data"
5. Wait for "Processing Complete!" message
```

#### Step 2: Run Pipeline
```bash
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8050/pipeline
2. Configure settings:
   - Signal Type: ECG/PPG/etc.
   - Processing Paths: FILTERED + PREPROCESSED
   - Enable Quality Screening: ✓
3. Click "Run Pipeline"
```

#### Step 3: Watch Progression
```bash
Expected behavior:
✓ Progress bar shows 12.5%
✓ Status: "Stage 1/8: Data Ingestion"
✓ Stage 1 icon changes to spinning blue
✓ Every 0.5 seconds, stage advances
✓ Previous stages show green checkmarks
✓ Connector lines turn green
✓ Progress reaches 100% in ~4 seconds
✓ Export/Report buttons enable
```

## Error Handling

### No Data Uploaded
**Error:** "⚠️ Error: No data uploaded. Please upload and process data first."

**Solution:**
1. Go to Upload page (`/upload`)
2. Upload and process your data
3. Return to Pipeline page
4. Try again

### Invalid Data Format
**Error:** "⚠️ Error: Invalid data format. Please process data on Upload page first."

**Solution:**
1. Go to Upload page
2. Click "Process Data" button (if not already processed)
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Return to Pipeline page

### No Signal Column Found
**Error:** "⚠️ Error: No signal column found in uploaded data"

**Solution:**
1. Go back to Upload page
2. Ensure you selected a **signal column**
3. Re-process the data
4. Try pipeline again

## Known Limitations

### Simulation Mode
Currently runs in **simulation mode**:
- Uses uploaded data for validation only
- Does not perform real signal processing
- Advances through stages automatically (0.5s each)
- Shows mock metrics in stage details

### Future: Real Pipeline Mode
When real pipeline is enabled:
1. Will process actual signal data
2. Quality screening will use real metrics
3. Processing time will vary based on data size
4. Stage duration will reflect actual operations
5. Results will be exportable

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. ✅ Test with uploaded data
2. ✅ Verify error messages work
3. ✅ Confirm stage icons update correctly

### Short Term (This Sprint)
1. Gather user feedback on workflow
2. Improve error messages if needed
3. Add more detailed stage metrics
4. Create pipeline result export functionality

### Long Term (Future Sprints)
1. Implement real pipeline integration
2. Add background task monitoring
3. Enable persistent pipeline state
4. Support batch file processing
