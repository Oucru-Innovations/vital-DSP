## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Streaming still accumulates in memory**
   - Even with streaming, final DataFrame is in RAM
   - Future: Yield chunks instead of concatenating
   - Workaround: Use segment-based processing

2. **Timestamp precision**
   - Vectorized timestamps use int64 nanoseconds
   - Limitation: Dates before 1678 or after 2262
   - Impact: Not relevant for physiological signals

3. **Fixed streaming threshold**
   - 100MB threshold is hardcoded
   - Future: Make configurable via environment variable

4. **Pipeline Stage 3 optimization**
   - Multi-path processing could be further optimized
   - Opportunity: Parallel path processing
   - Est. improvement: 20-30% faster

### Recommended Future Enhancements

1. **Priority 4: Caching System** (2-3 hours)
   - Cache expanded OUCRU data as `.npz`
   - 10-50x faster for repeated access
   - Automatic cache invalidation

2. **Generator-Based Streaming** (4-6 hours)
   - True constant memory usage
   - Yield processed chunks
   - Requires API change (breaking)

3. **Multi-threaded Array Parsing** (2-3 hours)
   - Parse multiple chunks in parallel
   - 2-4x additional speedup
   - ThreadPoolExecutor for json.loads()

4. **Compressed OUCRU Support** (1-2 hours)
   - Direct `.csv.gz` reading
   - Save disk space
   - pandas native support

5. **Additional Example Notebooks** (4-6 hours)
   - OUCRU format deep dive
   - Custom pipeline development
   - Advanced quality screening techniques
