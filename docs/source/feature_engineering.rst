Feature Engineering
====================

This section covers the feature extraction techniques provided by the VitalDSP library for analyzing physiological signals such as ECG and PPG. These methods help to derive meaningful features that describe various morphological characteristics of the signals.

Morphology Features
---------------------
Techniques to extract morphological features from physiological waveforms, including the detection of peaks, troughs, and various sessions in ECG and PPG signals.
Techniques for analyzing the amplitude variability of physiological signals, focusing on variability in systolic and diastolic amplitudes.
Methods for detecting the dicrotic notch and analyzing its properties in PPG signals.
Methods for calculating volume-based features in physiological signals such as systolic and diastolic areas.
