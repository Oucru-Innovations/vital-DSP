## Interpreting Results

### Quality Scores
- **0.0 - 0.3**: Poor quality (not suitable for analysis)
- **0.3 - 0.5**: Fair quality (use with caution)
- **0.5 - 0.7**: Good quality (suitable for basic analysis)
- **0.7 - 0.9**: Very good quality (suitable for advanced analysis)
- **0.9 - 1.0**: Excellent quality (ideal for all analyses)

### Processing Path Selection
The pipeline automatically recommends the best path based on:
1. **Quality Score**: Higher is better
2. **SNR**: Signal-to-noise ratio
3. **Artifact Removal**: Reduction in noise/artifacts
4. **Feature Stability**: Consistency across segments

**Typical Recommendations**:
- **RAW**: Only when signal is already clean (quality > 0.9)
- **FILTERED**: When signal has moderate noise
- **PREPROCESSED**: When signal has significant artifacts (most common)

## Current Mode: Simulation

The pipeline currently runs in **simulation mode** to demonstrate the interface and workflow. In simulation mode:
- Pipeline advances through stages automatically (0.5s per stage)
- Sample data and metrics are displayed
- All UI features are functional
- No real signal processing occurs

**Note**: Real pipeline integration is being optimized and will be enabled in a future update.

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Won't Start
- **Issue**: "No data uploaded" error
- **Solution**: Upload data via the Upload Data page first

### Pipeline Stuck at Stage
- **Issue**: Progress bar not advancing
- **Solution**: Click "Stop" then "Reset", try again with different settings

### Export/Report Buttons Disabled
- **Issue**: Buttons remain grayed out
- **Solution**: Wait for pipeline to reach 100% completion (Stage 8)

### Quality Score Too Low
- **Issue**: Signal quality below threshold
- **Solution**:
  - Lower quality threshold setting
  - Try PREPROCESSED path for better artifact removal
  - Check input data quality

## Best Practices

1. **Always Enable Quality Screening**: Helps identify poor-quality signals early
2. **Use Multiple Paths**: Compare FILTERED and PREPROCESSED to see processing effects
3. **Choose Appropriate Window Size**:
   - ECG/PPG: 30-60 seconds
   - EEG: 60-120 seconds
   - Respiratory: 60-300 seconds
4. **Set Overlap**: Use 50% overlap for better temporal resolution
5. **Select Relevant Features**: Only extract features you need to improve performance
6. **Review Stage Details**: Check each stage's metrics to understand processing
